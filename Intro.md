Hi, I’m Vasu, currently working as a Software Engineer at Tavant Technologies, with 3 years of experience in CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure, and containerized deployments across AWS and Azure.

I automate infrastructure using Terraform and AWS CDK, and design and maintain end-to-end CI/CD pipelines using GitLab CI, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions, integrating SonarQube and Checkmarx for code quality and security, and managing artifacts through Nexus.

I work on reliability, observability, and incident management. I’ve implemented monitoring and alerting using Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK, defined actionable alerts, and supported production incident response to reduce downtime.

On the cloud side, I work extensively with EKS, ECS Fargate, IAM, WAF, and GuardDuty, focusing on secure, reliable, and scalable platforms.

Overall, my focus is on stable releases, security-first automation, and improving operational efficiency.
