Hi, my name is Vasu Nurukruthi. I am a DevOps Engineer with around 3 years of experience working on CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and containerized applications.

I started my career at Atos (Eviden) as a Junior Associate, where I mainly worked on CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI. I supported build and release processes, integrated SonarQube for code quality, and managed artifacts using Maven and Nexus. I also used Terraform and Ansible to automate infrastructure and configuration tasks, which helped reduce manual work.

Currently, I am working at Tavant Technologies as a Software Engineer – DevOps. My role mainly involves supporting and maintaining production systems. I work on CI/CD pipelines, handle deployments, and support containerized applications running on AWS ECS and ECS Fargate. I also work with Terraform, CloudFormation and AWS CDK to provision cloud resources in a consistent way.

On the operations side, I use Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, and CloudWatch for monitoring, logging, and alerting. I am part of the on-call rotation, where I help resolve production issues, perform root cause analysis, and make sure systems are stable and available.

I have worked on projects in banking and financial domains, where security and reliability are important. I followed DevSecOps practices, used tools like SonarQube and Checkmarx, and supported secure releases.

Overall, I am comfortable with Linux, basic scripting, CI/CD automation, AWS services, and production support. I am still learning and improving my skills, especially in Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies, and I’m looking for roles where I can grow as a DevOps engineer.
