Hi, my name is Vasu Nurukurthi. I am a DevOps Engineer with around 3 years of experience working on CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure, and containerized applications.

I started my career at Atos (Eviden) as a Junior Associate, where I mainly worked on CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI. I supported build and release processes, integrated SonarQube for code quality checks, and managed artifacts using Maven and Nexus. I also used Terraform to automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration, which helped reduce manual effort.

Currently, I am working at Tavant Technologies as a Software Engineer – DevOps. My role mainly involves supporting and maintaining production systems. I work on CI/CD pipelines, handle deployments, and support containerized applications running on AWS ECS and ECS Fargate. I also work with Terraform, CloudFormation, and AWS CDK to provision cloud resources in a consistent and repeatable way.

In addition to DevOps work, I have experience with Windows Server administration, including server setup and management using Windows Server Manager, user access and service management, and IIS configuration for application deployment, site bindings, and basic troubleshooting.

On the operations side, I use Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, and CloudWatch for monitoring, logging, and alerting. I am part of the on-call rotation, where I help resolve production issues, perform root cause analysis, and ensure system stability and availability.

I have worked on projects in the banking and financial domains, where security and reliability are critical. I followed DevSecOps practices, used tools like SonarQube and Checkmarx, and supported secure and compliant releases.

Overall, I am comfortable working with Linux and Windows servers, CI/CD automation, AWS services, basic scripting, and production support. I am currently improving my skills in Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies, and I am looking for opportunities where I can continue to grow as a DevOps engineer.
