Hi, I'm Vasu. I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Tavant Technologies with 3 years of experience specializing in DevOps and Cloud.

My core expertise lies in CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure, and containerized deployments. I build and maintain infrastructure as code using Terraform and AWS CDK, and design end-to-end CI/CD pipelines with tools like GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and ArgoCD.

I've implemented comprehensive monitoring solutions using Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack, and defined actionable alerts, and supported production incident response to reduce downtime.

On the security front, I also worked on tools like SonarQube and Checkmarx into our pipelines to enforce code quality and security standards from the start. Coming to artifact repositories i used Nexus.

Ultimately, my goal is to enable stable releases through security-first automation while continuously improving operational efficiency."
